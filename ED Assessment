1. What is this type of design called?
# randomized block design

2. What is the purpose of blocking? How are blocks best set up? Explain whether
blocking was effective or not, in this case?

# The purpose of blocking is to reduce experimental error variance. The blocks are best set up when 
there is correct randomization of the treatments within blocks so that each volunteer would have been equally
likely to get either design.The blocking was effective because F > 1 so, it did reduce unexplained error variance.

3. The design was balanced. How many replicates were there per treatment? Show
your calculations.

N = r * a where 
N = number of experimental units and from 62 degrees of freedom there are 63 experimental units
r = replicates 
a = treatments and there are 3 treatments 
Thus the number of replicates are N / a, 63 / 3 = 21 

4. In Code Chunk 1, the line starting with Design shows the results of an F test.
What are the H0 and H1 tested in this line? What is the result of the test and what
conclusions do you draw about the research question this experiment was designed
to answer?

This line is testing the effect of design on distance.
The H0 is that all treatments have the same mean. H1: All treatments do not have
the same mean.The F value is large and the p-value small so we have evidence 
against H0 (F= 11.650, p < 0.001). That means that at least two treatments cause
a different mean response. 



5. Code Chunk 2 also has lines that start with Design. What do these two lines test,
what is the result and what conclusion do you draw?

The line tests the null hypothesis that the true parameter value is equal to zero.
The two lines test how much Design G and Design S differ from the reference level (Design F).
Design G and S traveled a lesser distance than Design F (-0.92 meters less and -1.56 meters 
less than Design F, respectively). One can conclude that for Design G and S there 
is some evidence that they differ from the reference level (Design F). This is 
because of the p values : 0.4929 and 0.2464 show some evidence against the null hypothesis.


6. In Code Chunk 2, what does the line starting with (Intercept) test? What are the
H0 and H1 tested in this line? What is the result of the test and what conclusion
do you draw? Is this a sensible test?
 
Ho: the mean of the reference treatment (Design F) is zero
This tests whether the mean of the reference treatment (Design F) is zero, that is, whether 
this treatment had no distance! This is not a sensible test because, if there was no distance travelled
in this treatment, this would have been obvious to the researchers. One can conclude that there is very strong 
evidence against the null hypothesis for  Design F (p<0.001).





7. What – if any – connection is there between the mean squares for Residuals given
in Code Chunk 1 and the residual standard error given in Code Chunk 2? What do
these numbers represent?

The relationship between them is that the residual standard error is the positive
square root of the mean square error. In the example, the residual standard error
would be equal to sqrt(2.653) , or approximately 1.629. The mean squares for the
residuals gove an unbiased estimate for sigma^2 and can be  obtained from the
ANOVA table. The mean square value for residuals = 2.653. The residual standard
error is our best estimate of average within-treatment standard deviation =  1.629.

8. In Code Chunk 1, the line starting with Design:Person shows the results of an F
test. What effect is this line testing? What are the H0 and H1 for this test? What
is the result of the test and what conclusions do you draw from this test?

This is testing for an interaction between the design and the person. 
The H0 is that the effect of the person on distance does not depend on the level of design. 
The F value is small (= 1)  and the p-value small is so we have some evidence against H 0. 
That means that there is some evidence that effect of the person on distance does depend on the level of design. 

9. How far did the G jets thrown by Russel fly, on average? Round to two decimal
places. 
 2.58000 +  6.00000 = 8.58m on average 
 
10. Code Chunk 3 shows the results of applying Tukey’s procedure to this analysis.
Explain what Tukey’s procedure does. Quantitatively describe what the results
shown in Code Chunk 3 tell us about the research question this experiment was
designed to answer.

Tukey’s procedure calculates all pairwise contrasts between the factor levels. It accounts
for multiple testing by adjusting the confidence intervals so that the experiment-wise
error probability is at the desired level. The output above shows the results of the 3 contrasts involv-
ing all pair-wise comparisons. We get an estimate of the difference
( diff ), the lower and upper confidence limits ( lwr and upr ), and
the p-value, adjusted for multiple testing ( p adj ). For example, 
have a look at the first contrast, between Design G and Design S treatments.
Relative effect of design on distance travelled.

11. In the call to the function TukeyHSD, what does the argument ‘which’ do and what
does it default to?
It lists the terms in the fitted model for which the intervals should be calculated. It defaults
to all the terms.

12. In Code Chunk 3, you can see that Tukey’s procedure calculates a 95% confidence
interval. If we had asked for a 99% confidence interval instead, how would the
interval have changed? Explain your answer.

To get higher confidence, we need to make the interval wider interval.  This is 
evident in the multiplier, which increases with confidence level.


13. Interpret the confidence interval for the G-S comparison
0.6330529 to 3.075519 and a p value of 0.0018208. The confidence interval is small 
and does not overlap zero. The p value is small and indicates strong evidence agaisnt H0.
And it means that the difference between the distance travelled
by Design G and Design S is between 0.6330529 to 3.075519 meters 95% of the time.


14. For a moment, you are thinking it would be more fun to visit sites within the
current extent of this species in South Africa and record whether soil type and
moisture is associated with occurrence of this species. What main advantages does
an experiment have over such an observational survey?
Only by experimentation can we infer causality. In addition, experiments make it
easy to analyse without multicollinearity. Lastly, experiments sace time and money
to optimize settings.


15. Back to the experiment: what design does your experiment need so that it can
address your boss’ questions? Explain.

Factorial because it is an experiment with more than one treatment factor in
which the treatments are constructed by crossing the treatment
factors.


16. List the factors, levels and treatments. What is the response variable?
Factors = soil type and water 
Levels = sandy and shale and low, medium and high
Treatments = sandy.low, sandy.medium, sandy.high, shale.low, shale.medium, shale.high
Response = Seedling survival 


17. Very briefly describe how you would set up this experiment so that it observes
the three fundamental principles of experimental design. What would you use as
experimental unit? (4)

Three Fundamental Principles of Experimental Design: Replic cate, Randomise and Reduce Unexplained Variation (Block- ing)
The plants are randomly assigned to a pot in the greenhouse 
The experimental unit is the pot that contains a plant. We may measure each plant, 
in which case the observational units are the plants. The blocking factor is location.
The experimental units at one location can be expected to have different characteristics
(more shady) than those at another location (more sunny). Randomization occurs
within each block. Each of the six treatments must be applied to several experimental 
units. This ensures that the variation between two or more units receiving the same 
treatment can be estimated and valid comparisons can be made between the treatments.
Thus replication can be done. 


18. You are planning to analyse the resulting data by ANOVA, which partitions the
variance into main effects and interaction effects. For your particular design, list
these effects. For which of these effects does your design have the highest power
and for which one does it have lowest power? Explain.

The main effects of the factor soil: soil has two levels.
The main effects of the factor water: water has three levels.
The interaction effect is Soil:Water

The design has the lowest power for soil. We would need to increase the number of replicates 
for the factor soil, or we need to be satisfied with detecting only larger differences
to be able to have a higher power. We would need fewer replicates for water to detect 
the same difference between water levels (low, medium, high), because we already have 
some hidden replication in the levels of soil. Thus the main effect of water has the highest power.
