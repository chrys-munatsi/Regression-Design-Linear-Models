1. What is this type of design called?
# Completely randomized block design

2. What is the purpose of blocking? How are blocks best set up? Explain whether
blocking was effective or not, in this case?

# The purpose of blocking is to reduce experimental error variance. The blocks are best set up when 
each design is given to a volunteer at least once. And that randomization occurs between the designs and the volunteers
.The blocking was effective because F > 1 so, it did reduce unexplained error variance.

3. The design was balanced. How many replicates were there per treatment? Show
your calculations.

N = r * a where 
N = number of experimental units and there are 63 experimental units
r = replicates 
a = treatments and there are 3 treatments 
Thus the number of replicates are N / a, 63 / 3 = 21 

4. In Code Chunk 1, the line starting with Design shows the results of an F test.
What are the H0 and H1 tested in this line? What is the result of the test and what
conclusions do you draw about the research question this experiment was designed
to answer?

H0: There is no difference between the treatments
H1: The difference between treatment means is not equal to zero
There is strong evidence that at least two of the treatment means differed from 
eachother (F= 11.650, p < 0.001). One can conclude that the means of at least
two of the designs differed from eachother.


5. Code Chunk 2 also has lines that start with Design. What do these two lines test,
what is the result and what conclusion do you draw?

The two lines how much Design G and Design S differ from the reference level (Design F) 
The intercept is the estimate of the first treatment (Design F) and the other two lines
Design G and Design S are the difference between the first and each other treatment.
One can conclude that there is very strong evidence against the null hypothesis for 
Design F (p<0.001). However, for Design G and S there is some evidence that they differ
from the reference level (Design F). Folded jets from Design G and S travelled a lesser distance than Design F.


6. In Code Chunk 2, what does the line starting with (Intercept) test? What are the
H0 and H1 tested in this line? What is the result of the test and what conclusion
do you draw? Is this a sensible test?

The intercept is the estimate of the distance travelled by the first treatment (Design F).
One can conclude that there is very strong evidence against the null hypothesis for 
Design F (p<0.001). No, it is not sensible.

7. What – if any – connection is there between the mean squares for Residuals given
in Code Chunk 1 and the residual standard error given in Code Chunk 2? What do
these numbers represent?

The mean squares for the residuals gove an unbiased estimate for sigma^2 and can be 
obtained from the ANOVA table. The mean square value for residuals = 2.653. 
The residual standard error is our best estimate of sigma for the dataset =  1.629. 
The residual standard error is our best estimate of average within-treatment standard deviation.

8. In Code Chunk 1, the line starting with Design:Person shows the results of an F
test. What effect is this line testing? What are the H0 and H1 for this test? What
is the result of the test and what conclusions do you draw from this test?

This is testing for an interaction between the design and the person. 
The H0 is that the effect of the person on distance does not depend on the level of design. 
The F value is small (= 1)  and the p-value small is so we have some evidence against H 0. 
That means that there is some evidence that effect of the person on distance does depend on the level of design. 

9. How far did the G jets thrown by Russel fly, on average? Round to two decimal
places. 
 2.58000 +  6.00000 = 8.58m on average 
 
10. Code Chunk 3 shows the results of applying Tukey’s procedure to this analysis.
Explain what Tukey’s procedure does. Quantitatively describe what the results
shown in Code Chunk 3 tell us about the research question this experiment was
designed to answer.

Tukey’s procedure calculates all pairwise contrasts between the factor levels. It accounts
for multiple testing by adjusting the confidence intervals so that the experiment-wise
error probability is at the desired level. The output above shows the results of the 3 contrasts involv-
ing all pair-wise comparisons. We get an estimate of the difference
( diff ), the lower and upper confidence limits ( lwr and upr ), and
the p-value, adjusted for multiple testing ( p adj ). For example, 
have a look at the first contrast, between Design G and Design S treatments.


11. In the call to the function TukeyHSD, what does the argument ‘which’ do and what
does it default to?
It lists the terms in the fitted model for which the intervals should be calculated. It defaults
to all the terms.

12. In Code Chunk 3, you can see that Tukey’s procedure calculates a 95% confidence
interval. If we had asked for a 99% confidence interval instead, how would the
interval have changed? Explain your answer.
The confidence interval would be wider because of greater uncertainty.



13. Interpret the confidence interval for the G-S comparison
0.6330529 to 3.075519 and a p value of 0.0018208. The confidence interval is small 
and does not overlap zero. The p value is small and indicates strong evidence agaisnt H0.
And it means that we are 95% confident that the difference between the distance travelled
by Design G and Design S is between 0.6330529 to 3.075519 meters.
