1. What is this type of design called?
# Completely randomized block design

2. What is the purpose of blocking? How are blocks best set up? Explain whether
blocking was effective or not, in this case?

# The purpose of blocking is to reduce experimental error variance. The blocks are best set up when 
each design is given to a volunteer at least once. And that randomization occurs between the designs and the volunteers
.The blocking was effective because F > 1 so, it did reduce unexplained error variance.
