# Question 1
# The number combinations of the factor variables across the 3 
# variables are six
# There are 8 observations of 5 variables.

# Find the average success rate for immature (pirating) eagles.
# Create a table of prop.success and see where it lies?

# Question 3
# Which of the six groups (two pirate age groups, two pirate size groups, 2 
victim size groups) has the lowest median success rate? I.e., what seems the 
single most important factor in determining success or failure in a pirating attempt?

# Question 4
