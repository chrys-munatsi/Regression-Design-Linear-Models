# 1. Figure 1 shows two scatterplots and two boxplots from the data exploration. What
can you learn from these plots?

From the Leaf fresh water content boxplot we see that the Venusta species has the most fresh water content, while there is not a big 
difference between the Punctata and the Hybrid species. From the elevation boxplot we see that the Hybrid species has the biggest elevation 
followed by the Venusta species and lastly the Punctata species. Regardless of leaf mass area, there does not appear to be much of a difference between 
the Venusta species and Punctata species throughout the years between the year 1750 to the year 2000. However, the Hybrid Species first appears only once between 
the years 1850-1900 and then two more times between the year 1950 and 2000. There appears to be a negative linear relationship between leaf
mass area and fresh water content for the Venusta species, on the other hand, there is no linear relationship for the Hybriid species. The Punctata
species also appears to have a weak negative linear relationship between leaf mass area and fresh water content.

where yi is the average leaf mass area, x3 is the measured elevation (in meters) and the xi's are dummy variables indicating 
each of the species Punctata and species Venusta categories and in both cases ei  ~ N(0,σ2)




# 3 Examine the first two models (m1 and m2). How has the estimated effect of Elevation
changed from m1 to m2? Why do you think it has changed?
The effect of elevation in model 1 is stronger, and has become statistically significant compared to the effect from model 2.
Model 2 adjusts for species whereas species is ignored in model 1. Species does not have a linear relationship with elevation.
i.e there's a very weak correlation between elevation and species. Ignoring species therefore masks some of the effect of
elevation on leaf mass area.



# 4
Interpret all regression coefficients (incl. the intercept) from model m2 and comment
on their statistical significance.
# Coefficients:
Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept) 1.158e-02 1.070e-02 1.083 0.2807
SpeciesPunctata -9.583e-04 2.342e-03 -0.409 0.6830
SpeciesVenusta -2.724e-03 2.321e-03 -1.174 0.2424
Elevation 9.950e-06 5.425e-06 1.834 0.0687 .


The mean response for the baseline level, here the species Hybrid, ß0 = 1.158e-02, is estimated by the intercept. 
The intercept estimates the average leaf mass area rate of change for the species Hybrid at zero elevation. There is 
some evidence against the null hypothesis (p=0.2807). It is statistically significant. The coefficient estimate 
for the categorical variable SpeciesPuncata, ßSpeciesPunctata = -9.583e-04 estmates the difference between baseline 
category and the species Puncata. This shows that leaf mass area for SpeciesPunctata is 9.583e-04 grams per cm2    
less than the species Hybrid at zero elevation. There is little to no evidence for a relationship between species 
Punctata and leaf mass area (p=0.6830). It is not statistically significant. The coefficient estimate for the 
categorical variable SpeciesVenusta, ßSpeciesVenusta = -2.724e-03. estimates the difference between baseline 
category and the species Venusta. This shows that leaf mass area for SpeciesVenusta is 2.724e-03 grams per  
cm2  less than the species Hybrid at zero elevation. There is some evidence for a relationship between species 
Punctata and leaf mass area (p=0.2424). It is statistically significant. The coefficient estimate for the 
Elevation variable is positive, telling us that the leaf mass area increases by 9.950e-06 grams per cm2 per
m increase in elevation. There is little to no evidence for a relationship between species Punctata and leaf
mass area (p=0.687). It is not statistically significant. In general, for all the regression coefficients 
the statistical significance is not that strong.





# 5. #6 #7 what is meant by “RSS” and explain how these numbers relate to the hypothesis test
being conducted.
It is the residual sum of squares and it examines the change in the amount of variance explained. For one extra parameter 
(degree of freedom) the residual sum of squares decreases by 0.00015637, comparing that to the MSE gives an F-statistic of 
10.825. The small p-value (p=0.001261) indicates that this change is unlikely under the null hypothesis (extra parameters
are all 0), and therefore there is evidence that the extra parameter improves the model.




#Examine the estimated “SpeciesVenusta” regression coefficient from model m4:
Coefficients:
Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept) -8.092e-01 2.495e-01 -3.243 0.00147 **
SpeciesVenusta -1.960e-03 6.881e-04 -2.848 0.00505 **
Elevation 8.901e-04 2.677e-04 3.326 0.00112 **
I(Elevation^2) -2.360e-07 7.172e-08 -3.290 0.00126 **

8. conduct the appropriate hypothesis test by stating the hypotheses and referencing
any relevant numbers from the output. (3)
H0 : The difference between the mean of the baseline category relative to SpeciesVenusta = 0
HA : The difference between the mean of the baseline category relative to SpeciesVenusta = -1.960e-03



9. calculate a 95% confidence interval for the effect. Comment on the interval relative
to your conclusion from the test above. (3)
-1.960e-03 +/- 2 * 6.881e-04
[-0.0033362, -0.0005838]
The method we use to construct the interval ensures that 95% of the time the interval will cover the true mean.
The intervak does not include 0 and so this is in sync with findinf the effect to be significant.

10. interpret the effect of “SpeciesVenusta”.
This shows that leaf mass area for SpeciesVenusta is -1.960e-03 less than the species Hybrid at zero elevation. There is some evidence 
for a relationshop between species Punctata and leaf mass area (p=0.00505). It is statistically significant.





Using model m5:
Coefficients:
Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept) 0.042090 0.003187 13.207 < 2e-16 ***
SpeciesVenusta 0.013154 0.004304 3.056 0.00268 **
FWC -0.011498 0.002776 -4.142 5.85e-05 ***
SpeciesVenusta:FWC -0.006993 0.003377 -2.071 0.04015 *

11. calculate the effect of FWC on LMA for both Punctata and Venusta species.




12. predict the average LMA for a Venusta plant with a FWC of 1.5 units. (2)
0.042090 + 0.013154 -0.011498 * 1.5 -0.006993
Answer = 0.031004



13. give an overall summary of how, according to this model, FWC affects LMA. (4)
The coefficient estimate for the FWC variable is negative, telling us that LMA decreases by -0.011498 grams
per cm2 per unit increase in FWC. There is strong evidence against the null hypothesis (p=5.85e-05). The negative
FWC effect suggests that species with a higher LMA are decreasing faster compared to species with a lower LMA. THe changes
are small, but small changes accumulate over the years 



Figure 2 shows the diagnostic plots from the model with only elevation in it (model m1):


14. is there anything in these plots that would make you worried about the model assumptions? Explain your answer. (3)




15. compare the points labelled 136 and 142 in the bottom right panel of Figure 2, and discuss in terms of leverage and influence.
Leverage refers to the extremeness of the ezplanatory variables  corresponding to an observation. Influential refers to observations
that have a large effect on the regression coefficients estimates whether they are included or not. The residual for obseravtion 
142 does not have high leverage and will not affect the fitted line too much. The observation at 136 does have high leverage but it is not
influential and does not exceed Cook's distance.
