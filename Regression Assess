# 1. Figure 1 shows two scatterplots and two boxplots from the data exploration. What
can you learn from these plots?

From the Leaf fresh water content boxplot we see that the Venusta species has the most fresh water content, while there is not a big 
difference between the Punctata and the Hybrid species. From the elevation boxplot we see that the Hybrid species has the biggest elevation 
followed by the Venusta species and lastly the Punctata species. Regardless of leaf mass area, there does not appear to be much of a difference between 
the Venusta species and Punctata species throughout the years between the year 1750 to the year 2000. However, the Hybrid Species first appears only once between 
the years 1850-1900 and then two more times between the year 1950 and 2000. There appears to be a negative linear relationship between leaf
mass area and fresh water content for the Venusta species, on the other hand, there is no linear relationship for the Hybriid species. The Punctata
species also appears to have a weak negative linear relationship between leaf mass area and fresh water content.
